# neuroevolution-
neuroevolution but simple


CREATION:
---to create new neural networks use Henrievolution({name of an activation function, how many you want, the architecture in an array form ([3,4,5])})

---example:
  ---var x = new Henrievolution({AF:'sigmoid',Pop:10,Layers:[3,4,5]})
  ---this will create 10 neural networks all using sigmoid with an architecture of 3-4-5 (note: the conenctions are currently set to connecting with all neurons in the previous     layer)

---Suported activation functions:
  ---sigmoid
 --- BSF
  ---Relu
 --- LRelu
 --- Tanh
---RUNNING:
---to run a given NN (nerual net) use the Henrievolution.Run(index of given NN, inputs in array form)

---example:
  ---x.Run(0,[0.2,0.4,0.1])

---EVOLUTION:
---use the function x.Mutate(mutation probability (a number from 1-100), the top percent you want to mutate)

---example:
 --- x.Mutate(40,2)
